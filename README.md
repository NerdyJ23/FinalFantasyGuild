# FinalFantasyGuild
 
An application made to test datbase viewing, updating and inserting for one of my java assignments. 
It allows you to insert members into a team/guild, save their name, character name + roles, and edit them if needed.

Needs a database set up (the SQL file is found in the SRC folder)
